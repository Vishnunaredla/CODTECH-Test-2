I’m excited to announce that I have successfully completed Task 2 at CODTECH IT SOLUTIONS. The project involved developing a Vulnerability Scanner Tool using Java.

Project Overview: Vulnerability Scanner Tool

Project Description: The Vulnerability Scanner Tool is a Java-based application designed to identify common security vulnerabilities in a network or website. It features three primary functionalities:

Port Scanner: Identifies open ports on a specified host.
Software Version Checker: Compares installed software versions against the latest available versions.
Misconfiguration Checker: Provides a placeholder for detecting potential misconfigurations.
Key Features:

Port Scanner:

Functionality: Scans a range of ports on a specified host.
Inputs: Host (IP address or domain name), start port number, end port number.
Output: Lists open ports within the specified range.
Software Version Checker:

Functionality: Compares installed software versions with the latest versions.
Inputs: Predefined lists of installed software and their versions, predefined list of latest versions.
Output: Lists outdated software with current and latest versions.
Misconfiguration Checker:

Functionality: Placeholder for detecting configuration issues.
Inputs: Not yet defined (for future development).
Output: Indicates any detected misconfigurations.
Code Structure:

VulnerabilityScanner.java:
Main Class: Contains the core logic for the application.
Methods:
main(String[] args): Manages user interaction and invokes checks.
isPortOpen(String host, int port): Checks if a port is open.
checkMisconfigurations(): Placeholder for misconfiguration detection.
Usage Instructions:

Save the Code: Save the code in VulnerabilityScanner.java.
Compile: Use javac VulnerabilityScanner.java to compile.
Run: Execute with java VulnerabilityScanner and follow prompts.
Potential Enhancements:

Advanced Port Scanning: Implement features for specific ports and protocols.
Software Version Database: Integrate a dynamic database for version comparison.
Configuration Checks: Add detailed checks for misconfigurations.
User Interface: Develop a GUI or web-based interface.
Error Handling and Logging: Enhance with robust error handling and logging.
This project lays the groundwork for vulnerability scanning and can be expanded into more advanced security solutions. I’m grateful for the opportunity to work on this and for the guidance from my mentor, Muzammil Ahmed.
